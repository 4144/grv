# GRV - Git Repository Viewer [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rgburke/grv.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rgburke/grv)

GRV is a terminal based interface for viewing git repositories. It allows
refs, commits and diffs to be viewed, searched and filtered. The behaviour
and style can be customised through configuration. A query language can
be used to filter refs and commits, see the [Documentation](#documentation)
section for more information.

GRV is currently under development and not feature complete.
